 For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in a past Weather PY assignment. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot with navigation between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Also website have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
